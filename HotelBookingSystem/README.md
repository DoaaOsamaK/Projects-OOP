## Question:
Develop a hotel reservation system where guests can book different types of rooms (e.g., Single, Double, Suite). Implement a base class Room with derived classes for each room type. The system should allow guests to view available rooms, make reservations, and apply different pricing rules based on room type and booking duration. Use polymorphism for calculating room prices and encapsulate guest information securely. Inheritance should be used to manage different room categories.
