# E-commerce Order Management System
## Question:
Design an E-commerce system where customers can place orders for multiple products.
There should be classes for Product, Customer, Order, and Payment. Each product should have a price,
category, and stock quantity. Implement methods for customers to add items to their cart, place an order, 
and pay using different payment methods (e.g., CreditCard, PayPal). The system should also support the concept
of discounts, where different categories of products may have different discount strategies. Ensure the use 
of polymorphism for handling multiple payment types and discounts, inheritance for common product behaviors, 
and encapsulation for managing sensitive data such as payment information.
